2 Part II - Mission Synthesis
In the second mission, your task is to develop an algorithm for synthesizing an immunizer serum, leveraging
unique Vitales molecular compounds to enhance the immune response in typical humans.

2.1 Background Information and Objectives
Initial attempts to inject typical humans with Vitales’ unique molecular compounds resulted in severe allergic
reactions. However, it was found that synthesizing a serum using typical human molecular structures as a base,
with the addition of Vitales’ immunizing compounds, significantly improved the human body’s acceptance.
A critical challenge emerged: if the bond between typical human and Vitales molecular structures is overly
strong, the serum’s efficacy is compromised. This is because the Vitales compounds fail to detach from the
human compounds, rendering them ineffective.
To address this, the serum must be synthesized by linking individual human molecular structures (serving as the
base) with Vitales structures known for their immunizing properties. The focus will be on utilizing molecules
with the lowest bond strength within each structure as the bonding points. This strategy ensures the serum
can easily break down once administered, allowing the Vitales compounds to exert their beneficial effects. For
this reason, the molecule with the lowest bond strength should be chosen as the bonding point for
each molecular structure.

When two molecules, i and j, form a bond, the resulting bond strength is calculated as the average of their
individual bond strengths.
Your mission is to develop an algorithm that will synthesize a new serum by identifying which bonds should be
formed among the identified typical human molecular structures and the unique Vitales moluecular structures.
In other words, your algorithm will determine which bonds will be chosen among the molecules with the lowest
bond strength in each molecular structure to comprise the newly formed molecular compound, i.e., serum, such
that the overall bond strength will be minimum. The serum will be fully synthesized when each molecular
structure is linked to this new compound structure via a bond to some other molecular structure
in this serum. Note that by forming a bond between two molecules in two separate molecular structure, we
obtain a new compound molecular structure.
